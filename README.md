# HexAddressing-system
Hierarchical Tree Management for Microsoft Access Database  This repository contains VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code designed for managing hierarchical tree structures in Microsoft Access databases. The code includes procedures for initializing paths in a tree, adding paths for new nodes, and deleting paths for existing nodes.
Features:
initPaths:

Initializes paths for a tree using a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal.
Generates paths and hex paths for each node in the tree.
Inserts the calculated paths into the corresponding database table.
addPaths:

Adds paths for a new node to an existing tree.
Determines the sort order for the new node based on existing siblings.
Inserts the new node's information into the calculated paths table.
deletePaths:

Deletes paths for a specific node in a tree.
Removes the corresponding records from the calculated paths table.
Usage:
Copy and paste the provided VBA code into the Microsoft Access VBA editor.
Adjust the constants and table names according to your database schema.
Call the relevant procedures to manage hierarchical trees in your Access database.
Note:
The code supports two types of trees, distinguished by the treeType parameter.
Make sure to customize the code based on your database structure.
